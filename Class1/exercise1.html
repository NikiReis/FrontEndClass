    <p>After turning on CNBC last Thursday to see SVBs stock price getting hammered and news of venture firms urging startups to hit the exits,</p>
    <p>EarthOptics CEO Lars Dyrud acted quickly. At 4 p.m. ET, he requested a $25 million wire transfer from Silicon Valley Bank, representing roughly 90% of his companys deposits</p>
    <p>It was too late. EarthOptics didnt get a response on Thursday, and the following day SVB was seized by regulators in the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.</p>
    <p>Dyrud had no idea when hed be able to access his companys deposits, as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. only guarantees $250,000 per client.</p>
